# (1) Task Estimation In Scrum
![Task Estimation](images/taskestimation.png)
Task estimation is an essential part of any scrum process. Team members must estimate
the duration and effort of each user story in the sprint backlog using a shared task list. Denise Canty 
outlines the benefit of task estimation on her [blog](https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/46054/Task-Estimation-with-Scrum#:~:text=The%20most%20commonly%20used%20Scrum,backlog%20item%20to%20similar%20items.&text=Story%20points%20do%20not%20measure,a%20user%20story%20or%20task.):
>This practice results in a shared team perspective, resulting in a task estimation process that
is consistent and reliable throughout all Sprints.


## Best Practices

- ##### Decide the value of a story point and stick to it.
  Story points do not have a set value, so it's up to the scrum team to decide on that value and 
  be consistent throughout the project. For example, if the value of a story point has been assigned 1 day,
  then a task which is assigned 3 story points would amount to 3 days of work. This allows for a clear
  understanding of relative levels of effort for a task compared to other tasks.

- ##### Decompose Tasks
  ![Decomposing Tasks](images/decompisition.jpg)
  The task list contains all task that need to be completed in order to complete the user stories. Larger, high level tasks should be broken down 
  into smaller tasks with improved detail, which will allow the team to create product deliverables from the task list items. However, ensure that 
  you are prioritising the most important items to decompose. 
  As Mark Layton says in his [article on scrum decompisition](https://www.dummies.com/careers/project-management/scrum-decomposition-definitions/):
  > A requirement must earn the right of your investment. Only the highest priority items deserve your time 
  in breaking them down into digestible requirements. Everything else can wait. This way, you are always only working on the most important things.

- ##### Outline Task Dependencies
  Once user stories are chosen, staff and technical dependencies should then be considered. By properly documenting
  these dependencies, the scrum team can determine the order in which to execute tasks. There are several types of dependencies, 
  including mandatory and discretionary, internal and external, or a combination of these. SCRUMstudy provide some good examples 
  in their [scrum dependency blog](http://blog.scrumstudy.com/dependency-determination-in-scrum-project/) to help understand 
  these dependencies, which will be shown below.

  **Mandatory**: This dependency can be a result of physical limitations, also known as "hard logic", or perhaps contractual 
  obligations and legal requirements that must be met. 
  >For example, work on the first floor cannot begin until the foundation of the building is complete.

  **Discretionary**: Discretionary dependencies are ones which are put in place by the scrum team by choice. They are usually 
  implemented due to prior experiences or accepted best practices, but are not necessarily required. 
  >For example, the team may choose to build the door and window frames before the full structure of the wall is in place.
  
  **External**: External dependencies are outside the scope of the scrum team, yet are necessary for the completion of the 
  project task. This could be certain tasks, activities or products that are outside of the team's control. 
  >For example, if the Scrum Team is not responsible for procuring the materials required for building the walls, then 
those materials and tasks related to their procurement are considered external dependencies.
  
  **Internal**: Finally, internal dependencies are task, activities or products that are within the scope and control of the 
  scrum team. They are basically part of the project work that must be completed. 
  >For example, installing drywall must be completed before painting the wall can begin.


# (2) Code Standards 

![Gitflow](images/Coding-Standards.jpg)

By definition coding standards are a set of practices and guidelines that determine the style 
and procedure of a specific programming language or project. These standards offer a uniformity and 
structure to massive code bases which have many developers collaborating on them with various different 
styles and habit's. 

***Why should you use code standards?*** 
<br>

Code standards offer many benefits to a team such as 
* Improves readability while also reducing complexity 
* Prevents the unnecessary reusing of code as well as highlights errors
* Encourages positive integration of teams 
* Reduce the overall cost of development 

<br>
coding standards offer tried and testing benefits to organisations 
and team's who utilise them, but the efficacy of these practices relies 
heavily on how the standards are embedded and what aspects of the 
project are considered important enough to follow procedure.


### Implementation

![Gitflow](images/tabs_vs_spaces.jpg)

How standards should be enforced is an important decision, things as 
major as class names and project structure as well as comment style all
have potential to be standardized. An example of some common practices are

* Ensuring functions do not exceed a certain size
* Indentation Styles (Tabs vs. Spaces)
* Ensure all filenames are the same format
* Control the access and scope of certain variables
* Efficiency versus Complexity
* Error handling procedure

These standards not only allow individuals to work more efficiently in a
group setting, but it also encourages an environment of excellence to which
people shrive to achieve. Code standards improve the
