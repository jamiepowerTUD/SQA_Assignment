By definition coding standards are a set of practices and guidelines that determine the style 
and procedure of a specific programming language or project. These standards offer a uniformity and 
structure to massive code bases which have many developers collaborating on them with various different 
styles and habit's. 

***Why should you use code standards?***

Code standards offer many benefits to a team such as 
* Improves readability while also reducing complexity 
* Prevents the unnecessary reusing of code as well as highlights errors
* Encourages positive integration of teams 
* Reduce the overall cost of development

coding standards offer tried and testing benefits to organisations 
and team's who utilise them, but the efficacy of these practices relies 
heavily on how the standards are embedded and what aspects of the 
project are considered important enough to follow procedure.


### Implementation

How standards should be enforced is an important decision, things as 
major as class names and project structure as well as comment style all
have potential to be standardized. An example of some common practices are

* Ensuring functions do not exceed a certain size
* Indentation Styles (Tabs vs. Spaces)
* Ensure all filenames are the same format
* Control the access and scope of certain variables
* Efficiency versus Complexity
* Error handling procedure

These standards not only allow individuals to work more efficiently in a
group setting, but it also encourages an environment of excellence to which
people shrive to achieve. Code standards improve the
