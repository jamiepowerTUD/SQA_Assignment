# (2) Code Standards 

![Gitflow](images/Coding-Standards.jpg)

By definition coding standards are a set of practices and guidelines that determine the style 
and procedure of a specific programming language or project. These standards offer a uniformity and 
structure to massive code bases which have many developers collaborating on them with various different 
styles and habit's. 

***Why should you use code standards?*** 
<br>

Code standards offer many benefits to a team such as 

1. Improves readability while also reducing complexity <br>
		- Methods can be unreadable and become difficult to maintain if a uniformity of style is not enforced.
2. Prevents the unnecessary reusing of code as well as highlights errors <br>
		- Reduces redundancy and simplifies error catching as the code is easier to understand.
3. Encourages positive integration of teams <br>
		- Allows team members to follow and collaborate on one anothers work.
4. Reduce the overall cost of development <br>
		- Coding standards lead to less major errors and setbacks within a project.
5. Offers accountability of work and ensure correctness of code <br>
		- Without coding standards in a team, each member of the team would have their own unique approach and style of writing code.

<br>
coding standards offer tried and testing benefits to organisations 
and team's who utilise them, but the efficacy of these practices relies 
heavily on how the standards are embedded and what aspects of the 
project are considered important enough to follow procedure.


### Implementation

How standards should be enforced is an important decision, things as 
major as class names and project structure as well as comment style all
have potential to be standardized. An example of some common practices are:

* Naming conventions ensure that classes, functions and variables names are consistent across the project. Names should be useful, prounceable and not misleading so any person looking at your code is able to easily understand.
* Ensuring functions do not exceed a certain size. Long functions can be difficult to easily understand and make the code appear more complex than it may be. Following the "Rule of 30", methods should not contain more than 30 lines of code (on average).
* Documentation. Comments within the code allow future readers to grasp the code much more thoroughly and in less time.
* Indentation. When we consider the above image of "Tabs vs spaces", we can see that a tab can be a number of columns, however a space is always just one column. You should use white space within your code to improve readability. Some useful rules to remember are that all braces should start on a new line, and after a brace is closed there should be no further code on that given line.
* Control the access and scope of certain variables. Variables should only be visible to classes and objects that need to see them. Avoid declaring global variables where possible.
* Efficiency versus Complexity. Big O notation can give us an understanding of the amount of time required by an algorithm.
* Error handling procedures. All functions in your code that return an error, should return either the value 0 or 1. This greatly helps in making the debugging process easier. <br>

These standards not only allow individuals to work more efficiently in a
group setting, but it also encourages an environment of excellence to which
people shrive to achieve. Code standards improve the 


***Negatives of not utilising code standards*** 
<br>

A coding standard  makes sure developers are following guidelines on projects. 
Without the implementation of standards the project can be considered to be missing the essential attributes necessary in software development. Without standards the particular work in progress can lack style, structure and have a mixture of procedures involved that will affect the consistency and have an overall negative impact on the quality of a program.
For most organisations, smooth functioning programs are vital for growth. Coding standards are needed for development success. 
<br>

Without standards projects may encounter some of the following **problems** 
 
* Developers can all have different styles and ways of doing things making team work more challenging and hard to follow
* Can become hard to enforce as procedures must be created in order to follow standards if they are implemented at a later stage, meaning code refactoring of projects/programs and change in code creation. 
* Certain standards may not be suitable for use on different languages, allowing programs to be written with incorrect syntax/semantics.
* Enforcing standards may be difficult to enforce in large teams and can be very time consuming.
* Less accountability for work in teams.
* Security concerns can be raised if code is inconsistent, logically incorrect or contain bugs.
* Can cause performance issues due to poor code quality with no standards to correct the issue.
* Difficulty in reading code for anyone as naming conventions and indentation may not be adhered to.
